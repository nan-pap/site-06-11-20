During my undergraduate studies in Biology, in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, my keen interest in studying the nervous system and behavior grew. Therefore, I proceeded in Athens International Masterâ€™s Programme in Neurosciences, in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, in order to concentrate upon the brain and how its orders are interpreted into behavior.) For my PhD, I am pleased to study the lateralization of the brain in the process of generating written letters and words both in adults and in children with dyslexia and/or dysgraphia, but also how this pattern of lateralization can be altered after phonological intervention.
