The TIDE program is a European Erasmus+ program coordinated by UNIMORE (University of Modena and Reggio Emilia) in Italy. The consortium also includes the Italian organization ForModena (Formazione Professionale per i Territori Modenesi Soc. Cons. a R.L.), Vienna's Education Council (Stadtschulrat f√ºr Wien) from Austria, Goldsmiths, University of London, from the United Kingdom and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens from Greece. 
TIDE collected data, good practices, and methodologies from all involved countries to develop new tools that teachers, educators and trainers can use with students with dyslexia. These tools were shared at all levels of the educational system from secondary education to vocational training institutions and universities, facilitating the transition of students with dyslexia from one level of education to the next.
