The almost explosive rate of growth in the research literature makes it increasingly diffi-cult for scientists to find the underpinning knowledge that the results carry; even more so when findings are confusing and conflicting. Literature reviews could never hope to han-dle such an abundance of data. 

Meta-analysis is a statistical method allowing for the integration and summarizing of the findings from a body of research in a clear, objective way. Importantly, meta-analysis al-lows for the assessment of any systematic variation among the results of different studies and, moreover, for the investigation of the sources of any such variance. Large-scale, high-ly powered meta-analyses can further help address the reproducibility issues that are at the forefront of scientific discussion within psychological research.

We have been applying meta-analytic methods in the field of laterality, a field overrun by the amount of published studies, with a special focus on handedness.  To date, we have investi-gated the prevalence of handedness, the sex differences in handedness, the prevalence of atypical handedness in populations with special educational needs (e.g., hearing impaired, Autism Spectrum, low or high intelligence) as well as in animals,  and further investigated  questions such as cradling laterality. We have also supported projects in terms of meta-analytic methods in the fields of mathematical cognition and ne-gotiations.
